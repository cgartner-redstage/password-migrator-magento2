# Lizard Media PasswordMigrator Magento2 module

A Magento2 module which helps you migrate user passwords when migrating data from
an existing e-commerce system. 

You have to save old customer passwords (possibly with salt). When a customer fails to
log in the module checks if the password provided is correct for the legacy system and
saves the password after encypting it using Magento build-in service and logs the customer in.

#### Features ####

* Allows customers to log into Magento using passwords from legacy e-commerce system
* Saves customers password as build-in Magento password
* Clears the legacy password table after a year/2 years/never since data migration

## Prerequisites ##

* Magento 2.2 or higher
* PHP 7.1

## Installing ##

You can install the module by downloading a .zip file and unpacking it inside
``app/code/LizardMedia/PasswordMigrator`` directory inside your Magento
or via Composer (required).

To install the module via Composer simply run
```
composer require lizardmedia/module-password-migrator
```

```
bin/magento module:enable LizardMedia_PasswordMigrator
bin/magento setup:upgrade

implement the interface
```
\LizardMedia\PasswordMigrator\Api\LegacyEncryptorInterface
```

```
LizardMedia\PasswordMigrator\Api\Data\PasswordRepositoryInterface
```
with
```
LizardMedia\PasswordMigrator\Api\Data\PasswordInterface
```
objects.

Each legacy password is removed after being used by the customer. You can configure the
module to clean the legacy passwords table after:
* a year
